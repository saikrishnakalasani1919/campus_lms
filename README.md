# Campus Bridge – Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

## Selected Domain  
Web development
 


## Problem Statement / Use Case  
To develop a unified platform that bridges the gap between academic learning and coding skill development. The platform should support Learning Management System (LMS) features and include coding practice modules with AI assistance to boost student success and employability.

## Abstract / Problem Description  
In today’s educational landscape, students use multiple disconnected platforms for academic coursework and coding practice. This fragmentation leads to inefficiency, lack of engagement, and missed learning opportunities. Campus Bridge aims to integrate academic management (LMS) and coding development into a single, seamless web application.

The system allows students to manage courses, practice coding with compiler support, receive AI-driven code hints, and prepare for placements. Faculty can create and manage courses, track student progress, and provide academic resources. Admins can oversee user management and ensure smooth operations. This all-in-one platform enhances learning efficiency, promotes self-paced coding growth, and builds job-ready skills for students—all under one roof.

## Tech Stack Used  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- Backend: Python (Flask)  
- Database: MySQL  
- Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Google Fonts, Font Awesome

## Project Explanation  

Campus Bridge is divided into major functional modules:
